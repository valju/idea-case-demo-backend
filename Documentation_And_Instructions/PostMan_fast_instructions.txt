GET requests are pretty straight forward:
- make sure GET Http verb selected from left
- write the request URL, sometimes e.g. http://localhost:3001/players  or /player/all    or old-fashioned /listPlayers
- (write possible GET requesrt parameters, e.g. id (KEY) 1001 (VALUES))
- Press "Send"
     - Look at the response at the bottom! (body, headers) ...

(When happy, you can press Save... see below)


POST requests are a step trickier:
- make sure POST Http verb selected from left 
- write the request URL, sometimes e.g. http://localhost:3001/player     or old-fashioned /addPlayer
- write the JSON POST data to the body: 
           * Click on "Body", 
           * then select "raw", 
           * then change "Text" to "JSON (application/json)"
- now write the JSON to the editor window in the middle
- Press "Send"
     - Look at the response at the bottom! (body, headers) ...
